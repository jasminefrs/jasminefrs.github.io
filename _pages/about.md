I am a doctoral student in Information Systems and Marketing at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. As a quantitative marketing researcher, I study how machine learning (ML) algorithms affect firms and consumers and how they influence market outcomes, with a focus on [algorithmic bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias){:target="\_blank"}. I use machine learning, analytical modeling and structural econometric modeling methods to study the economic implications of using machine learning in decision making and the (unintended) disparate impacts of ML-driven decisions across demographic groups.
