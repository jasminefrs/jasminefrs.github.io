I am a doctoral student in Marketing/Information Systems and Management at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. My research is about the social impacts of machine learning (ML) algorithms, with a focus on [algorithmic bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_bias){:target="\_blank"}. I use machine learning, analytical modeling and structural econometric modeling methods to study the economic implications of using machine learning in decision making and the (unintended) disparate impacts of ML-driven decisions across demographic groups.


Prior to joining CMU, I completed my undergraduate study at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, China in 2015.
