I am an Assitant Professor of Marketing at [New York University, Stern School of Business](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/){:target="\_blank"}. In my research, I study the economic and business implications of machine learning algorithms, with a focus on the unintended disparate impacts of ML-driven decisions across demographic groups. Using machine learning techniques, analytical modeling, and structural
modeling methods, I seek to understand and provide insights on how algorithms affect
decisions and behaviors in different contexts and how they may exacerbate or alleviate the increasing social inequalities.
